# Read Me
It was not entirely clear to me what should be included in this repository. As such, I have included all of the involved files.

This repository contains the files and folders necessary for the completion of assignment 7. This assignment focused on the various things that can be done in Jupyter Lab. Some of such things that are also demonstrated in this assignment include the following:
- the execution of python code and also the ability to execute them in any order, not necessarily in the order from top to bottom.
- the ability to write formulas in Jupyter using LateX code
- the use of magic commands such as timeit for findng the execution times of codes
